%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
	The aim of the project is to build a traffic signs detector able to recognize different types of traffic signs. The task is similar to the built-in computer of modern cars, in fact those  systems are capable to read traffic signs and to show, for example, which is speed limit in that road.
	The system will be based on a convolutional neural network, a specific neural network particularly suitable for the area of image recognition. 
	The main focus of this project is, given a road image with a traffic sign, to analyze the image, to detect the sign and to classify it via a multiclass classifier and then telling the user which kind of sign it is (or telling the driver what actions to perform in that scenario).
	In addition to this, we have expanded the functionality of this project to make it works even with video clips, so that the recognition of traffic signs takes place in real time.
