\section{Experiments 30\%}
Discuss the experiments that you performed. The exact experiments will vary depending on the project, but you might compare with prior work, perform an ablation study to determine the impact of various components of your system, experiment with different hyperparameters or architectural choices. You should include graphs, tables, or other figures to illustrate your experimental results.
