\section{Experiments 30\%}
Discuss the experiments that you performed. The exact experiments will vary depending on the project, but you might compare with prior work, perform an ablation study to determine the impact of various components of your system, experiment with different hyperparameters or architectural choices. You should include graphs, tables, or other figures to illustrate your experimental results.
%------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Experiments using the custom made dataset for images and video: different scenarios and light conditions.
- Difficulty of testing automatically the detection task so we dedicated a lot of time for manually testing 
- First experiment after the training of the classifier models is the accuracy value
