The idea behind this project is the development of an object recognition system. The term recognition refers to a suite of challenging computer vision tasks which can be divided into three categories:
\begin{itemize}
	\item\textbf{Image Classification}: predict the type or class of an object in an image;
	\item\textbf{Object Localization}: locate the presence of objects in an image and indicate their location with a bounding box;
	\item\textbf{Object Detection}: locate the presence of objects with a bounding box and types or classes of the located objects in an image.
\end{itemize}
In the last few years many application have been developed to explore different scenarios of object recognition through different techniques and deep learning models specifically dedicated. Moreover with the continuous improvement of computing power available for the user, great progress has been made in the field of general object detection. The large amount of online projects and papers demonstrate how this field is growing year after year.\\
The question is: what characteristics make our project different from others? The answer is summarized as follows:
