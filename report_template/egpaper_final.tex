%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   The aim of the project is to build a traffic signs detector able to recognize different types of traffic signs. The task is similar to the built-in computer of modern cars, in fact those  systems are capable to read traffic signs and to show, for example, which is speed limit in that road.
   The system will be based on a convolutional neural network, a specific neural network particularly suitable for the area of image recognition. 
   The main focus of this project is, given a road image with a traffic sign, to analyze the image, to detect the sign and to classify it via a multiclass classifier and then telling the user which kind of sign it is (or telling the driver what actions to perform in that scenario).
   In addition to this, we have expanded the functionality of this project to make it works even with video clips, so that the recognition of traffic signs takes place in real time.

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction 10\%}
Describe the problem you are working on, why it's important, and an overview of your results.\\
Image processing and its related algorithms are used to process digital images. Although it may seem recent technology, many of the techniques were developed in the 1960s. However, computers were expensive at this time and the digital imaging process required too much resources for many to even consider. The situation changed in the 1970s, when digital image processing began to be used massively as cheaper computers and dedicated hardware became available. With the accessibility to faster computers in the 2000s, digital image processing has become the most common form of image processing, able to compute different tasks such as image classification, video and real time detection. With the birth and growth of intelligent systems, Computer vision is increasingly used in the field of intelligent transport, which includes the subject of this paper: traffic sign recognition. These systems are typically based on detecting a region of interest (ROI), in which the traffic sign is located, recognising typical characteristics such as colour and geometric form.
Traffic sign recognition can be seen as a third eye which concerns a wide area of usages such as self-driving cars.\\

The application developed includes not only the standard functionality of image processing but also image and video detection and image classification. The original idea of combining different processes shows how powerful this tool can be.\\

The system described in this paper detects the area of the original image where the potential traffic sign is located, and tries to classify it. This is made possible through a long and accurate training process, based on a dataset of normalized traffic signs. TODO: The process starts with a preprocessing stage for the input image, where the parameters of the image, such as resolution or contrast, are modified to guarantee that the filters and algorithms used later behave properly. When the parameters of the image have been adjusted, an edge detection algorithm is used in order to determine the potential areas of the image where a possible traffic sign may be located. The next step is to separate the regions of interest (ROIs) found in the image and obtain the potential traffic signs. Every potential traffic sign is submitted to a recognition process, using a cross-correlation algorithm that compares each one with a database, which contains patterns of traffic signs. This software includes a graphical user interface, which allows the user to control each stage of the application. The results obtained show a high success rate, dependent on the environmental conditions of the input image and its resolution

%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Formatting your paper}

All text must be in a two-column format. The total allowable width of the
text area is $6\frac78$ inches (17.5 cm) wide by $8\frac78$ inches (22.54
cm) high. Columns are to be $3\frac14$ inches (8.25 cm) wide, with a
$\frac{5}{16}$ inch (0.8 cm) space between them. The main title (on the
first page) should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge of the
page. The second and following pages should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from
the top edge. On all pages, the bottom margin should be 1-1/8 inches (2.86
cm) from the bottom edge of the page for $8.5 \times 11$-inch paper; for A4
paper, approximately 1-5/8 inches (4.13 cm) from the bottom edge of the
page.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Margins and page numbering}

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept
within a print area 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches (22.54 cm)
high.
Page numbers should be in footer with page numbers, centered and .75
inches from the bottom of the page and make it start at the correct page
number rather than the 4321 in the example.  To do this fine the line (around
line 23)
\begin{verbatim}
%\ifcvprfinal\pagestyle{empty}\fi
\setcounter{page}{4321}
\end{verbatim}
where the number 4321 is your assigned starting page.

Make sure the first page is numbered by commenting out the first page being
empty on line 46
\begin{verbatim}
%\thispagestyle{empty}
\end{verbatim}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Type-style and fonts}

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used. If neither is
available on your word processor, please use the font closest in
appearance to Times to which you have access.

MAIN TITLE. Center the title 1-3/8 inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of
the first page. The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type.
Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and
adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or
prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Leave two blank
lines after the title.

AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title
and printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type. This information is to
be followed by two blank lines.

The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format.

MAIN TEXT. Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced. Do NOT use
double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx. 1/6
inch or 0.422 cm). Make sure your text is fully justified---that is,
flush left and flush right. Please do not place any additional blank
lines between paragraphs.

Figure and table captions should be 9-point Roman type as in
Table~\ref{mytable}. Short captions should be centred.

\noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type.
Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-,
second-, and third-order headings.

FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, {\large \bf 1. Introduction})
should be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, { \bf 1.1. Database elements})
should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
with one blank line before, and one after. If you require a third-order
heading (we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially
capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a period
and your text on the same line.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Footnotes}

Please use footnotes\footnote {This is what a footnote looks like.  It
often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.} sparingly.
Indeed, try to avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral
observations in
the text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence).  If you
wish to use a footnote, place it at the bottom of the column on the page on
which it is referenced. Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times,
single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text,
enclose the citation number in square brackets, for
example~\cite{Authors14}.  Where appropriate, include the name(s) of
editors of referenced books.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
Method & Frobnability \\
\hline\hline
Theirs & Frumpy \\
Yours & Frobbly \\
Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Results. Ours is better.}
\label{mytable}
\end{table}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

All graphics should be centered.  Please ensure that any point you wish to
make is resolvable in a printed copy of the paper.  Resize fonts in figures
to match the font in the body text, and choose line widths which render
effectively in print.  Many readers (and reviewers), even of an electronic
copy, will choose to print your paper in order to read it.  You cannot
insist that they do otherwise, and therefore must not assume that they can
zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.

When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use
\verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the  figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
                   {myfile.eps}
\end{verbatim}
}
