% Project proposal: no more than 3000 characters. Your project proposal should describe:                           

% What is the problem that you will be investigating?        

% What data will you use? If you are collecting new data,   how will you do it?                                          

% What method or algorithm are you proposing? If there are existing implementations, will you use them and how?        

% How do you plan to modify such implementations? You don't have to have an exact answer at this point, but you should have a general sense of how you will approach the problem you are working on.

\section{Problem}
The aim of the project is to build a traffic signs detector able to recognize different types of signs. Based on the information it receives, it can produce various outputs and show the result, for example, through graphs.
The system will be based on a convolutional neural network, a specific neural network particularly suitable for the area of image recognition.
The idea is to create an algorithm which can process not only images but also video frames.

\section{Dataset}
- images dataset for training \\
- collect video in different periods of the day (i video verranno utilizzati per valutare le performance del sistema o anche per effettuare del training?)

\section{Algorithm}
- do some research for already existing implementation
